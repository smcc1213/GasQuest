# GasQuest
**Created by Sean McConville and Adam Nethaway**

This application was created for our final project in Software Engineering II at MidAmerica Nazarene University

This is a cross-platform application that gives the location of nearby gas stations and allows the user to save information about their vehicle (e.g. money spent, average mpg) to their profile page on the app. This application was created using Xamarin.
