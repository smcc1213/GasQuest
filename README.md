# GasQuest
**Created by Sean McConville and Adam Nethaway**

This application was created for our final project in Software Engineering II at MidAmerica Nazarene University. This project was created over the course of 8 one-week sprints.

This is a cross-platform application that gives the location of nearby gas stations and allows the user to save information about their vehicle (i.e. money spent, average mpg, and total mileage) to their profile page on the app. This application was created using Xamarin.

*NOTE: The Firebase server has been closed and values for the Google Services .plist and .json have been removed. For this application to work as intended, you will need to provide your own Google Services .plist and .json values and create your own Firebase server.*

**How to Use GasQuest**

Upon opening the page, users may sign up by tapping "sign up" on the login page. After providing some basic information on the sign up page, users will be directed to the maps page. Users will stay signed in to the application every time they open application unless they press the Logout button located at the bottom of the profile page.

When on the maps page, users may click on the gas station icon on the bottom right to view nearby gas stations. Upon tapping a pin, the name of the gas station and user's distance from the gas station will appear. The user may then tap the name of the gas station to choose if they would like to be directed to the gas station's website or to Google Maps, where the route to the gas station and information about the gas price may be available.

When on the profile page, users may click on the profile photo to select a profile picture from their device. Tapping on the Add Fillup button will direct the user to the Add Fillup Page, where they can enter information about their fillup (i.e. gallons of gas received, amount paid), as well as their odometer reading. This information will be displayed on the user's profile. The average mpg will be displayed after adding two fillups. To change the home city label, simply click the edit icon next to the User's home city. Users may click on the "Add Vehicle" button to add the name or nickname of their vehicle which will be subsequently displayed on their profile.
